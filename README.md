>"For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit,
not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized."
 -- Jo Freeman from The Tyranny of Strucutrelessness
	    
GLI.TC/H is a festival/conference/gathering for artists and enthusiests interested in the conceptual and formal potential of glitches. GLI.TC/H is about creating a space (online && in-real-life) where the deeply invested and the mildy curious can come together to share resources, work and ideas + collaborate + debate + push the conversations fwd. GLI.TC/H is a formalized structure for open participation.
	    
the GLI.TC/H 2112 website was designed to reflect this ideology The gli.tc/h/bots have organized the structre (the HTML) which has no style or 'theme' && have invited others (in the form of an open CSS console) to create + contribute their own stylez. The console can be used to edit the site's CSS in realtime + can generate a .css file which is saved on the server && can then be invoked via the drop down list + generates a unique URL for the new version of the page.
